# A-B-Test-Results-Analysis

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to determine whether or not to launch a new landing page for an e-commerce website. The project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst nanodgree program in order to practice using statistical methods to analyze data. Specifically, the following methods were used to determine whether or not the new page should be launched:
- Probability
- A/B testing
- Logistic Regression

Work was conducted inside a Jupyter Notebook, *Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb*, which includes Python code as well documentation of the results at each step. The final conclusion was that the new page should not be lauched.

## Included Files:

The following files are included in this repository:

- **.gitignore**: Files that have not been included in this repository (not necessary to run the project)
- **Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.html**: Browser viewable version of project work file
- **Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing all project work
- **ab_data.csv**: A/B test results data
- **countries.csv**: contains the countries of each user


## Running the Jupyter Notebook
In order to run the main project file, *Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb*, you will need to install Jupyter Notebooks and Python 3, as well as the following Python Libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

You will also need to download the all *ab_data.csv* and *countries.csv* data files and place them in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
